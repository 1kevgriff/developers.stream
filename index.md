## developers//stream
A curated list of development streamers. If you're interested in being on this list, here's what I ask;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**-** Fill out an issue on the [github page](https://github.com/tbd-develop/developers.stream)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**-** Help promote the list (and in turn your fellow streamers) on your stream

This site is not unique, there are other sites out there that provide lists of streamers such as [Belly.io](https://belly.io/). I am also a proud member of the [Live Coders team](https://livecoders.dev/members), and if you're a dev streamer you may be eligible to join the team.
