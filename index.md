## developers//stream
A curated list of development streamers. If you're interested in being on this list, here's what I ask;

###### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**-** Fill out an issue on the [github page](https://github.com/tbd-develop/developers.stream)

###### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**-** Help promote the list (and in turn your fellow streamers) on your stream

This site is not unique, there are other sites out there that provide lists of streamers [Belly.io](https://belly.io/). Also, I am a proud member of the [Live Coders team](https://livecoders.dev/members).
